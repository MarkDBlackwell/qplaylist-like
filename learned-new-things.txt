  Learned new things:
Use Browser module for Elm cycle.
When importing, don't use "exposing." Always use qualified names and qualify the references; e.g., Html.div.
Import using "as." E.g., import Html.Attributes as A, then: A.src.
Design to avoid Maybe types, if possible.
Type alias of a record includes a constructor.
Each custom type variant includes a constructor.
Keep more code in a single big file.
Use custom types for state-space.
Custom types might somehow include pattern matching.
The constrained type variables are:
  number, appendable, comparable and compappend. See:
